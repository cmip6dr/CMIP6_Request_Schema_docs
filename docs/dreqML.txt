Data Request XML format
Martin Juckes, October 15th, 2018.

1 Executive Summary
The Data Request defines the diagnostics which are requested from modelling centres participating
in the sixth phase of the Climate Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6).
The Data Request is presented as two XML files: a configuration file and the content. Each file has
an associated XSD schema. The XSD schema for the content file is generated automatically from
the configuration file. For many users it will be more convenient to deal with the python interface or
web and spreadsheet versions of the request, which will be described in a separate document. The
transformation to an XML format from the traditional spreadsheet format is designed to deal with a
number of issues associated with growing complexity and a need to support automation driven by
the scale of the request. In order to preserve continuity, many of the records in the XML files will
have a direct relation to spreadsheet rows in the traditional format.
A separate document describes a simple python API for the data request.
The variables are now also listed in a spreadsheet of MIP tables:
proj.badc.rl.ac.uk/svn/exarch/CMIP6dreq/tags/latest/dreqPy/docs/CMIP6_MIP_tables.xlsx
In release 01.beta.27 a supplement was added, containing records on quality control and (under
development) information about physical relationships between variables. The supplement is
presented as a separate file in order to simplify the version management of the main request
document.

2 Objectives
The broad objectives of the data request are:
(1) Define variables, together with technical information required for generation of output files;
(2) Define collections of variables, from specified experiments, which are needed for or relevant to
specific scientific objectives;

4 Overview
Configuration file
The XML Data Request is presented as a configuration file and a content file.
The configuration file contains three types of information:
(1) Layout information which is used to generate the content schema;
(2) Comments on the purpose and intent of attributes;
(3) Technical labels to facilitate automated navigation of the contents.
If users wish to exploit the XML files directly it is recommended that they make use of the
configuration file, as the information types (2) and (3) are not embedded in the content file.
Each section of the document is defined by a “table” element with the following attributes:
•

label (e.g. 'var'): a name for a section of the content – will be used as the XML element
name;

•

title (e.g. 'MIP variable”): a longer, human readable string;

•

id: an opaque name;

•

itemLabelMode: specifies whether the “label” attribute of records in this section should
permit use of '-';

•

level: an integer, designed to assisted automated processing by giving an indication of the
structure of the request;

•

maxOccurs: maximum number of times the section is allowed;

•

labUnique [Yes|No]: set to yes if label values for records are unique within each section.

Within each section there are definitions for attributes of items. Each item attribute is defined using
the following configuration attributes:
•

label: this will be the attribute name;

•

title: a longer string explaining usage;

•

class: the class supports automation. e.g. attributes which refer to another record in the
document will have the class set to “internalLink”;

•

type: the xsd content type (e.g. “XS:STRING”);

•

techNote: to support automation. e.g. if class is “internalLink”, this attribute should be set to
the name of the intended section:

•

required: indicates whether the attribute is required;1

•

usage: notes on the usage of the attribute.1

Since 01.beta.33 all properties (title, valid_max, valid_min, etc) in all sections have been given a

valid title to aid legibility of the document: the titles of the attributes can be used, for instance, to
provide help notes in a web display of the data request.
In addition to the standard XSD content types “string”, “boolean”, “integer”, “duration” and “float”,
the following types are defined:
•

st__integerList: a list of integers;1

•

st__integerListMonInc: a monotonic increasing list of integers (monotonicity is not checked
by the XSD schema, but is verified by the python API);1

•

st__floatList: a list of integers;1

•

st__stringList: a list of words;2

•

st__attLabel_def: a string composed of characters “a” to “z”, “A” to “Z”, “0” to “9” and “-”;

•

st__attLabel_und: a string composed of characters “a” to “z”, “A” to “Z”, “0” to “9” and
“_”;

•

st__attLabel_an: a string composed of characters “a” to “z”, “A” to “Z”, “0” to “9”;

•

st__uid: a-zA-Z0-9:_.+-

•

st__fortranType : string defining a variable type: “real”, “integer”, “character” or “double”;

•

st__configurationType : a string defining a model configuration option : “size”, “category”,
“ioOption”, “capability”.

The above attributes provide the framework for detailed description of data request attributes and
diagnostics.

Content file (dreq.xml)
The content file contains three elements at the top level: “prologue”, “main” and “annex”3. The
“prologue” contains Dublin Core metadata describing the document and a PAV version attribute
holding the document version4. The “main” element has the sections specified in the configuration
file, and within each section a list of records (“item” elements). Each item element has attributes as
specified in the configuration file, a different set of attributes for each section. There are no child

elements or text content, all the information is in the defined attributes. Every item, across all
sections, will have at least these 3 common attributes which are intended to give basic information
about the item, thus enabling standardisation in error tracking:
•

uid: an identifier which is unique within the document;

•

label: a short name, using only the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and '-' (in some sections the '-' is
disallowed);

•

title: a longer name.

The “annex” element also contains a list of sections with the same structure as in the “main”
element. The “annex” has been introduced to allow some flexibility in the version management.

Sections
There are 35 sections in the current document, 6 of which contain information about variables,
output format and their priorities. An index to the request sections is available here: http://clipcservices.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index.html .
The sections, with section numbers, are listed below:
1.1 Model Intercomparison Project [mip]
1.2 MIP Variable [var]

Each MIP variable record defines a MIP variable name, associated with a CF Standard Name.
1.3 CMOR Variable [CMORvar]

Each Output variable record corresponds to a MIP table variable specification. In a change from the
August draft, this record does not contain the “priority” attribute: the priority is now set in the
“Request Variable” record. The other change is that a collection of attributes specifying dimensions
have been moved into the “structure” record, and each “CMOR Variable” record links to one
structure record. This will facilitate provision of clear and consistent definitions of output formats.
A “processing” attribute provides additional guidance on processing in some cases.
1.4 Request variable (carrying priority and link to group) [requestVar]

The request variable is now a short record which combines a CMOR variable with a priority and
assigns it to a request group. The request variable records define the contents of each
request group.
1.5 Experiments [experiment]

The experiment record contains the key information from the “Experiment” sheet of the request
template, including the tier of the experiment, the duration and start/end dates. The default
ensemble size is specifed by “ensz”; some MIPs may request data from more than the default
number of ensemble members.
1.6 Scientific objectives [objective]

The objectives defined by each MIP can be used to select data requirements.
1.7 Specification of dimensions [grids]

A section for the CMOR dimensions specifies the structure of the axes of the requested diagnostics.
1.8 CF Standard Names [standardname]

The reference list of CF standard names is provided at cfconventions.org, but the definitions of
terms used in the data request are copied into this section so that the detailed definitions are easily
accessible to data request users.

15/10/18

1.9 Experiment Group [exptgroup]

The experiment group defines a collection of experiments within a MIP which might be part of a
collective data request.
2.1 Spatial dimensions [spatialShape]

The spatial shape record contains the spatial dimensions of the field, and also, for convenience, an
integer specifying the number of levels if that number is specified. A boolean level flag is set to
“true” if the number of vertical levels is specified.
2.2 Temporal dimension [temporalShape]

The temporal shape record contains the temporal dimensions.
2.3 Dimensions and related information [structure]

The structure record combines specification of dimensions, cell_measures and cell_methods
attributes. Spatial and temporal dimensions are specified through links to “spatialshape” and
“temporalshape” records.
2.4 MIP tables [miptable]
3.1 Request variable group: a collection of request variables [requestVarGroup]

The request variable groups collect variables.
3.2 Request Item: specifying the number of years for an experiment [requestItem]

The request item links a collection of variables with a specific experiment or group of experiments,
and a temporal range for output. The “esid” attribute links to an experiment, and experiment group
or a MIP. In the latter case, the request applies to all experiments defined by that MIP. The Request
Item includes a “Tier Reset” attribute (“treset”)5 which can override the Tier assigned to the
experiments identified by “esid”. Has an optional link to a time slice3.
There is an “nenmax” attribute which specifies the number of ensemble members that the request
applies to. A value of -1 implies that data is wanted from all ensemble members. If “nenmax” is
greater than “ensz” it implies that the requesting MIP wants more simulations than the default
ensemeble size.
3.3 Request link: linking a set of variables and a set of experiments [requestLink]

The request link records specify some additional information about variable groups, concerning
shared output requirements and objectives.
3.4 CMOR Table Sections [tableSection]
3.5 Model configuration options [modelConfig]
3.6 Links a variable to a choice element [varChoiceLinkC]

Presence of a link indicates that there is a choice of different representations for a diagnostic.
3.7 Link between scientific objectives and requests [objectiveLink]

Each objective link record joins one objective to one request link. Some requests are linked to
multiple objectives and most objectives are linked to multiple requests.
3.08 Remarks about other items [remarks]

The remarks section contains additional comments about other records. It can be used to add detail
without adding to the complexity of the other sections.
3.09 Links a variable to a choice element [varChoiceLinkR]

Indicates that there is a ranked choice of variables, and that only one of the ranked list is required.

3.10 Indicates variables for which a there is a range of potential CMOR Varibles [varChoice]

There are several instances where variables defined in the tables are mutually exclusive options of
which only one should be requested. The varChoice section is designed to hold this information, but
is not yet complete. Examples are between ocean cell volume on a fixed grid for some models and
monthly means for others, or between 6 hourly pressure level data on 8 levels vs. 4 levels for
different objectives in the HighResMIP request.
3.11 Time Slices for Output Requests [timeSlice]

Specifies time slices (i.e. subsets of an experiment when data for the full duration of the experiment
is not required).
4-5: section omitted for possible later use.
6.1 Tags

Tags related to processing requirements associated with some diagnostics to aid automated
processing.
6.2 Relations between CMOR variables [varRelations]6

Provides structured information about the difference between variables of the same name and
frequency in different tables. E.g. different masking, temporal mean vs. point, different vertical
structure (model levels vs. pressure levels).
6.3 Variable relation link [varRelLnk]

Provides links between CMOR variables and varRelation records.
7.1 Cell Methods [cellMethods]
Quality Control Ranges [in supplement]

Extends the information provided in the valid_min, valid_max, ok_mean_min_abs,
ok_mean_max_abs attributes which were present in the CMIP5 CMOR tables. In this section there
are also attributes valid_max_status etc which indicate the level of confidence in the suggested
limits:
•

robust: A well characterised limit based on a rigorous constraint (e.g. and area fraction must be
between 0 and 1) or on a large ensemble of consistent model results.

•

suggested: A limit which may not be reliable, but which is based on a range of models or
plausible arguments.

•

tentative: Very limited information – e.g. only one or two models in CMIP5 provided the
parameter.

Further discussion is available in a draft document on Quality Control range 7, and web pages
presenting a review of CMIP5 ranges shows the information being used to construct the control values 8.

X.2 Data Request Attributes [__main__]

Attributes used to in the content records, such as “units”, “valid_max”. Each record in this section
defines one of these attributes, specifying its type and other properties used in the python API.
X.3 Section Attributes [__sect__]

Defines the attributes which are used to describe each section.

Caption: Linkage between data request elements. The Endorsed MIPs link to several
different records because of the multiple roles they play in creating the request. CMOR
variables, for example, link to the MIP which is responsible for defining the variable.
15/10/18
The complete list of variables requested by a MIP, which typically includes many
variables defined in CMIP5, is obtained by following the the request links associated
with that MIP, filtered by experiment(s), priority and objective if you are interested in a
selective list. Dashed lines indicate links which are optional or supplementary. Solid
lines indicate the primary links needed to decipher the request.

5 Discussion
The layout of the variable definitions has been rationalised into 5 sections: the “MIP variables”
defining the physical parameters, “structure”, “spatialShape” and “temporalShape” defining output
configuration and a “CMOR Variable” bringing all these together. The Request Variable table then
links CMOR variables together in Request Groups. The request groups give the MIP coordinators
the ability to pick and choose precisely the variables needed for each analysis, avoiding requests for
unnecessary data. This will result in request groups which contain overlapping data requirements.
The use of links back to CMOR variables make it possible to unambiguously determine the union of
any set of request groups.
The sections on structure and shape separate out different aspects of the CMOR variable
specification and make it possible to ensure that terms are used consistently. The contents if these
sections in this draft have been created by scanning the CMOR tables, and there is some duplication
(e.g. the cell_measures variable attribute is set for some variables and omitted for others, creating
two sets of structure records which are identical except for this distinction. In CMIP6 the
cell_measures attribute will always be set).
The link between the request items and the experiment definitions is not fully implemented in this
version, but the links through to the variables are. This means it is possible to gain an estimate of
the data volumes for each MIP and for combinations of MIPs, but not yet to select specific tiers in a
clean way (see dreqPy.pdf for more details). The data volumes given by the current version should
be treated with caution. The contents may not fully reflect the intentions of the MIP coordinators,
and there may be adjustments to variable priorities.
